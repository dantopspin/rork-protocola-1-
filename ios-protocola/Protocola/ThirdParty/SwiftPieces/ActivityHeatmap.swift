// description: "A streak calendar for habit, fitness, study and journaling apps: weeks of days drawn in one Canvas as rounded cells in solid steps from a pale red mix up to pure red, laid out by the locale's first weekday with month labels on their week columns, a light streak numeral that stays alive until midnight beside the longest run and active days, a scrub that lifts the day under your finger with a callout and a haptic tick per day, sideways scrolling that opens on today when the weeks outgrow the width, and VoiceOver that steps day by day or plays the weeks as an audio graph."

/// A calendar heatmap of daily activity with the current streak, a scrub callout and full VoiceOver support.
///
/// Columns are weeks, oldest leading and newest trailing, and rows are weekdays in the calendar's order, so
/// Monday-first regions get Monday on top. Each day is one rounded cell: level 0 is an empty field and levels
/// 1 to 4 are solid steps of the accent mixed into the ground, up to the pure accent. Drag sideways across the
/// grid, or press and move, to read any day, and tap to select one; vertical swipes still scroll the screen.
/// When the weeks outgrow the width the grid scrolls sideways and a short hold starts the reading instead.
/// The cells are drawn in one `Canvas` and hit-tested by geometry, so a year of days stays light.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - counts: Activity per day, such as sessions, minutes or entries. Each key is placed on the day it falls on in `calendar` (its time zone), so exact timestamps work and several on one day add up. Zero, negative and non-finite values count as no activity. Days outside the visible weeks are ignored, except that a current streak which began earlier is counted in full. `[Date: Int]` works too.
///   - weeks: How many week columns to show. Defaults to 20. Cells grow to fill the width up to `Style.maximumCellSize`; when they would fall below `Style.minimumCellSize` the grid scrolls sideways and opens on the newest week.
///   - endDate: The last day shown; later days in its week are left out. `nil` (the default) is today, and the grid moves on by itself at midnight.
///   - calendar: The calendar for days, weeks and the first weekday. `nil` (the default) uses the environment's calendar, which is the person's own.
///   - levels: How values map to the four shades. `.automatic` splits the non-zero days in view into quartiles. `.thresholds([1, 3, 6, 10])` sets the minimum for each level, and its first value is also what counts as an active day for streaks.
///   - showsSummary: Shows the current streak, the longest streak and the number of active days above the grid.
///   - selection: The selected day, as the start of that day. Tapping a day selects it and tapping it again clears it; with a binding, a scrub moves it live and release keeps it. Without a binding, a scrub shows the callout only while the finger is down. Setting it from outside selects that day and scrolls it into view.
///   - messages: Built-in copy. Defaults are localizable through your String Catalog; replace any line, for example `title` with "Workouts".
///   - style: Colors and cell metrics. Defaults to the SwiftPieces house palette with a red accent, adapting to light and dark.
///   - valueLabel: How a day's value reads in the callout and to VoiceOver, for example minutes formatted as a `Measurement`. Defaults to the plain number. Days with no activity read `messages.noActivity`.
